Insert story ~ Brother and Sister in Two States ~

A little further back in time, after Ekaterina ran away from Alexei.

During a short break after the afternoon class, Alexei covered his eyes with his hands, elbows on his desk, and sighed several times.

In the previous lesson, Alexei had a rough time. He was completely absent-minded, and when the teacher asked him a question, he not only couldn't answer, he didn't even know what the teacher was asking him. He was stunned when the teacher said, "it's okay". It was an unacceptable blunder for him, who has always had a flawless class attitude since he entered school.

Next to Alexei, a large male student appeared.

"Hey, Duke. What happened to you today? Is something wrong?"

He says curiously. With his fiery red hair, golden eyes, tall and stunning muscles, he is Nikolai Krymov. He is the son of a Count family.

Nikolai has a carefree personality and speaks to Alexei, who is estranged from everyone in the class, even the teachers, in the same way he talks to everyone else.

There are no class changes at the magic school, and everyone has been the same for three years. He knew that there were people who called Alexei "Duke" behind his back, in the sense of making fun of him for the work he had done in the Duchy’s territory since his first year. But Nikolai is the only one who calls him by his nickname to his face.

He did not blame him for this because of the debt that the Yurunova family once owed to the Krymov family. However, even after actually inheriting the title, Nikolai’s deep voice still called him ‘Duke’, which felt like a name that was unique to him, not a title, and no longer unpleasant.

Alexei secretly thinks Nikolai is the exact opposite of himself. Even if he doesn't intend to, Alexei makes the air tense just by stepping into a place, but Nikolai seems to make the place warm and peaceful just by being there.

And now Alexei was too weak. That’s why he said what he did.

"... I made my sister cry."

"What?"

Nikolai rolls his eyes.

"Oh come on, is that why? My sister is a creature that's crying all the time. If I leave it alone, I'll be in the wrong, and I'll be hit by my dad or mom. He sees it and makes me crazy."   %% the last sentence is translated using some Japanese phrase in deepl, should it be preserved with a TL note? (akanbei)

He also seemed to have a younger sister, and the second half of the story was just a blur.

It's strange that the Count and Countess are ‘father’, ‘mother’, and ‘punching’, but the Krymov family is special. It is a family that has passed down the secret technique of breeding and training mixed-race horses with demon beasts. While many aristocrats throw even the rule of the territory to a caretaker, the head of the Krymov family is known to work on a vast ranch and pick up foals by hand during the foaling season. And the Countess of the present generation is said to be the daughter of a powerful Marquis family, but she liked horses so much that she rushed to be a wife of the Krymov family and was called a ‘special talent’ by the previous Countess.

Nikolai said, "Ah," as if he remembered something.

"Well, your sister is here, isn’t she? Isn't she a beautiful girl with indigo hair and purplish blue eyes? 

Yeah, she was so mature and beautiful that I couldn't believe she was a freshman. She was so fair that she seemed to be transparent, and she was so thin that it seemed she would break. At first glance, she seemed difficult to approach, but when I told her where you were, she politely thanked me. She was nice, but she had a kind of elegance that was amazing.

I'm sorry, that is a different creature from my sister. If that's your sister, then mine’s a monkey . " % % do I have this comparison right?

Hahaha, Nikolai laughs.

"Beautiful women competing for one or two in this year's freshmen are making noise. It seems that they call her the Blue Rose. There is another beautiful woman who stands out, they call her the Cherry Blossom.

Anyway, why did you make such a graceful sister cry? Even though you cherish her so much that you’d be depressed. "

"There was something wrong with her friendship... The classmate she brought with her as a friend was of disproportionate status..."

"Huh"

The answer seemed surprising, and Nikolai groaned.

"When I told her not to go out her, she didn't like it and cried.

Well, if you're the Duke of Yurunova, you'll have to be wary of strange things coming in ... but your sister hasn't known that for a long time, right? "

"She hasn't been socializing … much. She's been on a long … retreat."

"Oh, by the way, you came late after the entrance ceremony, saying that your sister had collapsed. I guess she’s weak, she’s more and more different from my monkey.

But then, wouldn't that classmate of different status be the first friend she’s made?"

Alexei eyes widened at those words.

That was exactly what it should have been. Far from having friends, when she was in the territory, she was reported to not open up to anyone, to the point that that servants near her side rarely even heard Ekaterina's voice.

After coming to the imperial capital, Ekaterina began to speak so brightly, that it was difficult to even imagine what was reported. So it was forgotten.

"If you say that kind of thing too strongly, it’ll get complicated if you're not too careful.

Was that classmate an undesirable type that you couldn't let her go out with? "

"No……"

I remember Flora, who talked about her origin without being humbled. It made her feel more dignified than a poor aristocrat.

"But ... I wanted her to learn about aristocratic relationships. She doesn't know anything yet, and she's too kind. I wanted her to have a network that would protect her ..."

Alexei clammed up. The closer you are to the person, the more tricky it is, and he knows this all too well.

He suddenly thought.

--- What would grandfather do?

Grandfather Sergei used people regardless of their status if they were capable. But that's the story of his subordinates. His grandfather's best friend Forli was the third son of a Marquis family, and though he was later cut off from his parents' home, he was born into a family worthy of a friend.

But ... my grandfather had a half-brother. Alexei's great-uncle, the bastard Isaac. I heard that my grandfather and great-uncle were close brothers even if their mothers were different, and that my grandfather loved his younger brother, who was five years younger, from an early age. A bit eccentric but kind, Isaac was now a well-known scholar and interacts with people of all statuses. He would have brought her to his grandfather.

Even if Alexei brought a commoner friend to his grandfather, it was unthinkable that his grandfather would have had any say in their friendship.

Yes, my grandfather wouldn’t interfere. Thoroughly excluding friends of different status ...

Alexei grabbed his bangs.

(Ekaterina ... you were right)

An angry and screaming voice revives in my ears like a fire.

It is grandmother who oppressed me.

[I’m the same as grandmother who … tortured mother ...] %% this line and the last I mainly used context from chapter 16 to TL, would it be accurate?

He had always used his grandfather as a guide, and after his death he intended to protect the Duchy of Yurunova from the tyranny of his grandmother. I, not my father, took over the duke family from my grandfather. I had such pride.

But before I knew it, I was dyed by my grandmother's thoughts.

I wonder if she will ever ask me to hold her hand again...

I was tapped on my shoulder.

"Duke, Hey Duke, what's wrong? Yurunova. Alexei."

Alexei came back to himself as Nikolai called to him.

"Are you okay? You’re pale. Are you sick?"

"No. I'm fine."

Nikolai smiles at Alexei, who shakes his head stubbornly.

"It feels like the Ice Rose has melted and withered."

"What……?"

"I don't know, it's a nickname that some girls are have for you.

Well, don't get too depressed. Brothers and sisters are brothers and sisters for the rest of their lives, there will be times when things get a little rough. I think it's okay to forgive a friendship for three years at the school. Unless you’re afraid that the friend will teach her something strange."

For a moment, Alexei smiled at the edge of his lips.

"... It's just cooking."

"Ah?"

"She learned how to cook from her friend and brought it to the office. She wanted me to eat properly."

"Is there such a younger sister in this world?"

Nikolai snorts with a straight face.

"My monkey will eat as much as I have if I have rice. But when I ate her sweets, she chased me around the yard waving a pitchfork.”

A pitchfork is a huge fork that can kill people and is used to scoop grass on a ranch.

"Unlike my monkey, your sister is an angel. I don't think you have too much to worry about. You should talk to her tomorrow to see if she's worried about you."

"Yes ... that's right."

Alexei stammers, his decisiveness back in the office long gone.

I didn't feel like I could talk to her because I was afraid of being rejected.

The Next Morning.

Alexei appeared quite as usual which made Nikolai laugh.

"Good morning, Duke. You look well."

"Oh, good morning. About yesterday’s matter, my sister visited me after school and resolved it. I apologize for the inconvenience."

Alexei says clearly.

Then he looked down and said in a soft voice. Embarrassed.

"Thank you for your advice ... Thank you for yesterday."

"Oh"

Nikolai laughed with a grin but then quickly frowned and rubbed the back of his head.

"What happened?"

"Ah, I got a little stab in my eye ... It’s nothing."

The women's dark battle over Alexei, which Nikolai is not familiar with, seems to be sending stray flying bullets to the boys as well. No, it’s not a battle, because it’s too difficult for anyone to approach him directly, and the situation has become incomprehensible as the status quo has been upset. Something has happened to Alexei to create a lot of excitement that he did not understand. A smile at the entrance ceremony, for example.

It's a difficult thing.

"Well, good for you."

Nikolai said, Alexei nodded with a faint smile, and a silent scream echoed through the classroom.
